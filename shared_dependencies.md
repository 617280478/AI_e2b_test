1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") for styling. It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use Tailwind CSS styles.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will contain utility classes for styling the website. These classes can be used in the "index.html" file and can be customized in the "styles.css" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file that can be used for styling and scripting. They are shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and potentially any JavaScript files.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for styling elements in the "index.html" file. They are shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css".

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" to select and style elements in "index.html".

4. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are classes provided by Tailwind CSS for styling. They are shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css".

5. Import Statements: These are used in "styles.css" to import the "tailwind.css" file, and in "index.html" to link to both CSS files.
